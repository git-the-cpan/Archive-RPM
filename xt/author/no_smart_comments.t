=head1 NAME

no_smart_comments.t - make sure we don't still "use Smart::Comments" somewhere

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

This test ensures we don't release any Smart::Comments out there. 

=head1 TESTS

This module defines the following tests.

=cut

use strict;
use warnings;

use English qw{ -no_match_vars };  # Avoids regex performance penalty

use File::Find::Rule;
use FindBin;
use Module::ScanDeps;

#use Test::More tests => XX;
use Test::More;
use Smart::Comments;

my @files = File::Find::Rule
    ->file
    ->name('*.pm')
    ->in("$FindBin::Bin/../../lib")
    ;

plan tests => scalar @files;

for my $file (@files) {

    my $href = scan_deps(files => [ $file ], recurse => 0);

    # ## $href
    is exists $href->{'Smart/Comments.pm'} => q{}, "$file w/o Smart::Comments";
}
